# Unity__Gun-Game
### University task
###### Unity, C#
#### Running
All you need will be an C# editor (like MS Visual / Visual Studio) and Unity (I have used v2020.3.1f1 Personal)
Technically Unity might cause some issues while importing data, as many of project files are temporary Unity Editor and Compilation Data, included in .gitignore file.
#### Description
A simple 2D game with a character running left and right shooting enemies. I'm a bad artist so it doesn't look the preetiest of all the games.
#### Side Notes
With Facebook API

Here is a sample of how it looks like:
